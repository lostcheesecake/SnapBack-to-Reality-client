## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

```md
I created an app that allows users to upload a sneaker/shoe with details of the
sneaker's brand, style, and color. Then they are able to see a list of other
sneakers that they created, along with sneakers created by other users.

```

## Write between 3-5 user stories

```md
- User will be able to sign up
- User will be able to sign in
- User will be able to sign out
- User will be able to change password
- User will be able to create a sneaker resource
- User will be able to delete a sneaker resource
- User will be able to update a sneaker resource
- User will be able to see a list of the sneakers resource
```

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

```md
A one-to-many table with user having many sneakers,
and sneakers will have brand, style, color

```

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

## Problems I had

```md
I had many problems that I ran into while creating this project, the hardest one
was getting the backend to work, I had to redo the entire back end because the
problem wouldn't dissapear, with the problem being a constant 500 error.

```


## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

```md
- Work methodically
- Create wireframe and ERD
- Get both repos setup
- get heroku setup
- Get backend api ready with curlscripts
- check for errors, fix them
- console log when needed
- Get frontend client ready

```
